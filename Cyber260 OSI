1- OSI stands for Open System Interconnection. This is a seven layer model used in computer systems to communicate over a network. There are data pieces caelled Protocol Data Units (PDU) which get processed through the different layers, removing it headers along the way.

2- Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, this will allow the user to capture the packets processing through their machine. There can be filters and different other flagging systems to help figure out which packets are for each process.

3- Promiscuous mode is a network interface functioning in a manner to be operatiing, it does not interfere with a normal network communication. Instead the network interface is displaying all data it recieves in the programs capture window.

4- The PDU assoicated with the top three layers of the OSI model are formatting the protocol based on the network service or application being used, Encryping and encoding data, and controlling dialog between end system applications. Examples are network services, protocols and client request, File Transfer Protocol FTP, Telnet, and Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP

5- HTTP uses GET messages to request for data.

6- HTTP uses OK to tell the client when the request for the image and should be sent to the cleint's web browser.

7- The source port is randomly generated between 49152-65535 this range of ports is a dynamic port.

8- The well known port for HTTP is Port 80, the well known port range is 0-1023 it may also be called the System Ports.

9- The set flags in 7, 13, and 22 are:SYN for #7, SYN + ACK for #13, and ACK for #22. (Syn is used to reuqest a connection from the client to the server. ACK+SYN is used to achknowledge the request for a connection from the client to the server. ACK is used to tell the serve ror client that the data can be recieved.)

10- A dynamic port.

11- A system port or a well known port.

12- The IPv4 is 32-bits in length, in a dotted decimal notations, and the IPv6 is 128-bits in length and is eight groups of four hexadecimal digits.

13- A time to live is a number that is used to represent the amount of hops (routers) that the packet can go through befrose it will be discarded. 

14- The PDU associated with the network layer is the packet.

15- A MAC address is 48-bits.

16- A MAC address is 6-bytes. A byte is made up of 8 bits. A bit is a 0 or 1.

17- The first three bytes ( Or 24 bits) of the MAC Adres are represented by the Organizationally Unique Identifier(OUI) the last three bytes (or 24 bits) of the MAC address are a serial number assigned to the NIC by the manufactuer.

18- Ipconfig /all is a command you can use to see all of your devices and their information on a windows machine.

19- The PDU associated with the OSI modle are bits(bytes depending on size)

20- True a bad cable would be apart of the physical layer of the OSI.

21- True as these are bits or bytes configured on the media.
