Network topology
	Physical topology 
	-(routers, wireless, etc) high level overview of network devices
	
	Logical topology

	Router connects two different networks.

	Bus topology 
	-Used shared ethernet, each message if for a specific MAC address.
	-Older tec.
	-Multiple simultaneous transmissions.
	-No redundancy if network cable fails.
	-One signal at a time.
	
	Ring topology
	-Older tec where messages travel in a logical "ring"
	-Dual ring provides redundancy.
	-Fails more gracefully
	-A token moves in a circle of all the connected devices, Pc1->Pc2->Pc3 and loops.
	-It is slower than BUS is fewer devices are transmiting because you will have to wait your turn.
	
	Star topology
	-Common topolgy in most orgs
	-Switch connects to all devices
	-Host send message through switch
	-No redundancy planned.
	-If the switch goes down so does all communications
	-Switch can connect to other switches to extend the network.
	-Hub is physical.
	Logical switches will manage the connections so there will not be collisions.
	
	Mesh topology
	-Commonly used to connect routers to internal networks.
	-Creates redundant paths
	-Fully mesh connects are expensive.
	-Five devices mean there are 10 links
	- s N(N-1)/2
	- EXAMPLE  SanFran -> Detroid/LA/New York -> Miami, Repats. 
	
	Hub and spoke topology
	-Interconnects different locations.
	-Example traffic send to main office.
	-No direct communications have to go through the main connection.
	-Good for secuirty.
	-Bad if the main offices goes down.	
	-More long range, may have a Client - Server model inside of it to connect other things.
	
	Hub and spoke WAN connection,
	 Office -> Main office 
	 Internet -> main office
	 Main office -> Office
	
	Peer to peer networks
	-No centralized management.
	-No centralization causing security issues.
	-Ok for small networks (10 hosts)
	-Torreting, allowing users to share files accros a network
	-Peer to peer is dangerous.
	
	Client - Server model
	-Dedicated distrubted services.
	-Emails and data bases.
	-Easy to expand.
	-Client goes to the servver, the server then will connect to other things then get back to you.
	
	
Different types of networks
	Personal Aera Network(PAN)
	-PAN communicate over short distances.
	-EXAMPLE Bluetooth connection.
	
	Local Area Netowork(LAN)
	-Lans exist withone a single geographical location.
	-Interconnects devices to share resources.
	-Routers functions as the default to forward traffic from one network to another.
	-Example Workstation -> Switch -> Firewall -> Router
		 Above is a connection used to get a comptuer to the internet.
		 
	Wireless LAN is like a modem.
	Hard wired connection throughout different buildings, Campus Area Network(Lans connected by high speed)
	
	Metopolitan Area Netowrk
	-Located within a metropolitan area.
	-Connected by common carriers or ISP.
	-This is different because this is not owned by you, you have to go through ISP's or common carriers.
	
	
	Wide Area Network(WAN)
	-Expands to a larger geographical distance.
	-WAN connections by managed service providers (MSP) or internet service provider(ISP)
	
	Storage Area Network (SAN)
	-Shared network storage connected by high speed, fiber optic switches and cables.
	-Redundancy is key(Having fault safes)
	If one thing fails will pick it up and finish.
	
	Software defined networks/SD-WAN
	
	-SDN centeralized controller makes routing decisions
	-SD-WAN allow software to automatically configure a WAN solution.

	Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
	-Switching technology that conencts networks over large geographical distances.
	-Interface independing, could use(metro ethernet(metroE), fiber optic, DSL)
	-Quality of servicec QoS to prioritize by traffic type.
	-Packets into the network are taggled by the label edge router(LER) on the Provider Edge (PE) of the service provider's network.


Different types of tunneling.
	Generic Routing Encapsulation(GRE)
	-Tunneling techonolgy that allolws a tunnel between one side to another over the internet.
	-Traditional tunnels arent as scaleable.
	
	Multipoint generic routing encapsulation(mGRE)
	
	Service-Related Entry Points, ways to connect to the internet.
	-Fiber access terminal(FAT), fiberconnection option to the customer premise(fiber to the home) (FTTH)
	-Demarcation points - these are locations where the customer network and providers network meet.
	-Demarcation points are modems/routers.
	
	
Different ways that ISPS will provide connection to the internet.
	Local loop is your houses connection to the centeral office.
	Satellite Connectivity
	-Low earth orbit(LEO) Satellites
	-LEO Sat's are good for internet connectivity.
	-Latency may not be suitable for time sensitive apps like Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
	-Some applications will drop if not getting packets getting sent and received over a quick enough time.
	
	Digital Subscriber Line(DSL)
	-Symmetric DSL (SDSL) - upload and download rates are the same very expensive and limited in distance.
	-Asymmetric DSL (ADSL) - faster downloads than upload speeds.
	
	Cable
	-Install a cable modem, ISP network connected to a Cable modem-Termination system (CMTS) using coaxial cables.
	
	Leased lines
	-This is provided to be always on, guaranteed, dedicated bandwidth. Expensive.
	
	Metro Optical
	-Fiber optic solutions for providing high speed network between the customer and ISP.
	-Works with ethernet techonolgies so its a less expensive solution.
