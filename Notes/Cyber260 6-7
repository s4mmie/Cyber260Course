Network Protocols
-ICMP used with ping and traceroute(tracert) tha measure latency between routers (hops) on a network
-Pings send 4 IMCP echo request and will receive 4 ICMP echo replies.

Network Services 
-Network Time Protocol(NTP) synchronizes clock/times on all servers, clients, and devices on the network using port 123
-Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol automatically provides IP address, client uses UDP port 68, DCHP server uses port 67
	-Client send DHCP Discover packet using broadcast packet.
	-All servers who see it will respond with DHCP Offer that contains IP Address of the server
	-Client will select first one it receives and send a DHCP Request to get an IP (the client still doesn't haev an ip)
	-After server checks its scope it will send back a DHCP Acknowledgement(ACK) via unicast.
	-DHCP Relay agent can forward across routers(routers don't pass broadcast traffic without DHCP Relay Agent)
