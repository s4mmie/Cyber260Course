Where to put access points?
	-Omnidirection antennas will broadcast equal distance.
	-Make sure your signal doesn't bleed outside.
	-Directional antenna will go in a straight direction(unless an object is in the way which may cause it to pass through to get absorbed)

How do you implament a wifi network?
	-Router -> Firewall -> Switch -> Client
				/\Access point <- Wireless point
	Determine the design
		-Distance
		-Type and number of obstacles
		-Coverage
		-Interference
		
		Site Survey
			-20% overlap
			-look at types of walls
			-studying building blueprints
			-Consider if wifi access points will be used
			
	Configure wifi connectivity devices
		-Admin password
		-SSID to broadcast or not
		-Secuirty options
		-If DHCP is used
	Configure wifi clients
		-On boarding involves installing a program or app onto a devices to give it trusted access to certain protions of the network
		-Off boarding remove programes that gave devices special permissions on the network
			-Administrators need a feature that allows them to off board remotely incase the device is lost or stolen
	Wifi network secuity
		-Authentication allows a client to log on to the network providing the right password
			-Pre-Shared key (PSK) used to share a password
			-EAP(Extensible Authentication Protocol)
			-Open authentication(no auth)
			-Wifi protected setup(WPS)
			-Captive protal
		-Mac filtering prevents from authenticating any device whose mac address is not listed
		Encryption algoritms
			-WEP was made in 1997 too short of an intialization vector
				-WEP can be cracked in 5 minutes
			-WPA assign a dynamic trasmission key
			-TKIP(Temporal key integrity protocol
				-Message integrity
				-Key distribution
				-Encryption WEAK
			-WPA2 uses stronger data confidentiality
				-CCMP(Counter mode) with CBC(Cipher Block Chaining)
				-Ecryption AES(256bit keys)
			-WPA3
				-Strongest security
				-Backwards compatiable for wpa2
