WLANs will transmit signals through the air via RF (Radio Frequency)

Wireless Spectrum
	-9KHz -> 30GHz
	-RFID(Radio Requency Idenification)
		-use electromagnetic fields to store data on a small chip in an RFID tag, which includes an antenna that can transmit and receive and possibly a battery.
		
	-NFC(near-field communication)
		-Tapping a phone or card to pay
		-One way transmission
		-RFID Blockers good for secuirity
	-Z-Wave
		-Signaling to manage wireless connections and control to transmit data and commands between devices
		-Is a smart home protocl that provides two functions
	-ZigBee
		-HVAC control
		-AMR(Automatic Meter Reading)
		-Fleet management (A feelt of cars)
	-Bluetooth
		-Most bluetooth devices require close proxmity
		-Hops between frequencies reduces interfenerence
	-ANT+
		-Tracks information from sensors typically embedded in heart rate monitors, GPS devices, and other acivity monitoring devices.
		-ANT+ can sync data frmo multiple devices
		-Smart watches smartphone, fitness equipment
	-IR(infrared)
		-Exists just below the spectrum visable to the human eye

Channel Management
	-FHSS(Frequency hopping spread spectrum)
		-Used by the military, if you are out in the field, ways to make it so the enemy cant listen in. 
	-DSSS(Direct sequence spread spectrum)
		-Used a wider frequency so more vulnerable to interfence
		-wifi uses this
	-LOS occurs when the signal travels in a straight line directly from transmitter to reciever
	-Wireless signals do not usually follow a straight line
	-When obstacles are in a signal's way the signal may pass through or be
	
	-Attenuation the farther the signal moves away from the source the more it weakens
	-Wireless signals can be amplified by incrasing the power or by extended or repeating the signal a closer broadcast
	
	-Fading is when a signal ruds into obstacles its energy will gradually fade
	
	-Interference- electromagneti waves can interfere with wireless communication
	
Ways singals can move
	-Refraction
	-Reflection
	-Scattering
	-Defraction

802.11 
	-Channel bonding
		-Combined two channels together for a bigger tunnel
		two 20MHz for a 40MHz channel
	-MIMO(Multiple input multiple output
	-802.11 Frames
		-802.3 has different ethernets
		-Destination -> Go to mac
		-Source -> The source's mac
		
		-Three groups
			-Management frames
			-Control Frames
				-Include information of the session setup
			-Data Frames
				-Things that have data
	
Association and Wireless topologies
	-Association is the process where packets are exchanged between computer and an access point in order to gain internet acces
	-Scanning surveys its surroundings for an access point
		-Active scanning 
		-Passive scanning
	-SSID Network Name (unique string to identify an access point
	-IBSS Independent basic service set
		-ad hoc networking
		-no access point
	-BSS Basic set service
		-most common type where you juts connect to a router or access point
	-ESS Extended service set
		-using a mesh topology
			-one connects to everything else
		-access points use the same SSID Extended SSID
		-Managed by a wireless LAN controller
