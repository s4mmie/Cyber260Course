Running multiple OS's would require a partition on your hard drive and reboot.

VM's would allow us to carve out hardware resources for each O\S we would like to run.

A hypervisor application is running on the host O/S manages the access to the uest machine.

A well run enviorment will have 
-production enviorment
-testing enviorment
-RND enviorment 

Types of hyper visors
	TYPE 1 
	-would be seen in a data center
	-2500 servers on one box
	-No operating system host
	-"Bare metal" / Direct access to hardware
	
	TYPE 2 
	-runs on a host 
	-The hyper visor links the OS to the VMs
	-Hyper visor manages the hardware interaction
	-
	
vNic/vSwitch
-Each vm has a vNic to acess the network 
-A vSwitch is like a hyper visor for acessing the internet

CSMA/CD is the MAC protrocol wired ethernet
CSMA CA
	Collision Detection
	Collision Avoidance
	
Which is true about fiber optic cables
-More Expensive than copper Cables
-FALSE:Less Fragile than coaxial cable
-Uses LED or lasters

How many wire pairs are in the WTP CAT 5 Cable 
-4

This ethernet standard supports 100 MBPS over twisted pair 
-100BaseT

What connector do we use with the wired ethernet
-RJ-45

Which type of hyper visor do you run on your laptop
-Type 2

IPV4 vs IPV6
-Uses 128 bits - Uses 32 bits
-Consist of 8 roups of 4 hexadecimale powers of 16 (0 -> F) - Consist of 4 8 bit fields.
-Provides IPSEC and QoS - Has to be installed and included.

Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
-Private range of 169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.254 (Subnet mask 255.255.0.0)
-Dynamic host configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to automatically assign ip addresses

Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
-IPv6 can use DHCPv6 to obtain up address or use SLAAC
-Unlike DHCPv6 SLAAC doesn't keep a ercord of the IP pinadress.

Communication types
-Unicast: One to One
-Multicase: one to many
-Broadcast: one to all(IPv6 doesn't broadcast)
-Anycast: used on IPv6 for one to nearest communication
-Local loopback- 127.0.0.1 in IPv6- ::1/128

255 is reserved to broadcast, example -> 192.169.1.255 this will broadcast to 192.169.1.0-254

Tunneling encapsulates IPv4 inside an IPv6 packet it comes the data portion of the packet.
