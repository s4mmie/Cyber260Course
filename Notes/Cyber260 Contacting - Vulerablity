**High Availabity Planning**
-Service Level Agreement(Cloud service providers(You must have a 99.99% uptime))
-A strategy for enabling high avaliabity(HA) is to build fault tolerance and redundancy into hardware
=To understand HA strategies, the following terminology should be remembered=
	-MTTR(Mean time to report) - total time needed to fix an issue Total Repair time divded by number of repaits
	-MTBF(Mean time between failture) - Predicted tiem between outages
	-RTO(Recovery time objective) - the time your network can reasonably tolerate an outage
	-RPO(Recovery point objective) - the amount of historical data you'll need to be able to restore from backup in response to an outage

**Diverse Path**
-To provide for HA in our communications, as an example, we would plan on diversity in our telecommunications services.
Coperate Network -> R1 -> ISP_A -> Internet -> Data Center (No redundant paths)
		   ->	ISP_A \
Coperate Network -[		-> Internet Data Center
		   ->	ISP_B /
		   
**Infrastucture Redundancy**
-Fault tolerance: The ability of a system to operate normally, despite failure of its parts.
	-Ways to do this: 
	-Have a device that will detect all flow into the network
	-Load balance firewalls:Distributes work loads across all available resources through the use of algorithms to determine which servers or devices will receive the traffic.
			=examples of load balance=
			-Round robin: next available server receives request
			-Weighted round robin: servers with high weightings receive more request.
			-Least connection: The server with the least amounts of connections.
-Clustering: Combining devices so they are viewed as a single device, able to use the resources of all in tandem, however if a single unit fails the others continue to provide service
-NIC Teaming:Allows NICs to be combined into a group to provide fault tolerance in the event one fails.
-Port aggregation: Similar concept to clustering, combining multiple physical ports on a device into one logical port on a device through a protocol such as link aggregation control protocol(LACP)

**Disaster Recovery Planning**
-Business continuity is the ability of a company to continue doing business with the last amount of interruption as possible
=Example= What would happen if elon musk or mark zuckerberg died, what would happen to the company
-A DPP should include:
	-Contact names and phone numbers for emergency coordinators
	-Details on which data servers are backed up, how frequently backups occur, where are the backups kept, how backed up data can be fully recovered
	-Details on network topology redundancy and agreements with national service carriers
	-Regular strategies for testing the disaster recovery plan
	-A plan for managing the crisis

**Disaster Recovery Contingencies**
-Cold site: components necessary to rebuild the network exist, but they aren't appropriately configured, updated, or connected
-Warm site: components necessary to rebuild the network exist, with appropriately configured updated and connected
-Hot site: components necessary to rebuild the network exist and match the network's current state (all updated and configured)
-DRaaS(Disaster recovery as a service) provides a highly salable, inexpensive disaster recovery

**Power Management**
-Power surges can cause serious damage to sensitive computer equipment
-Things to learn:The nature of an electric circuit & Electrical components that manage electricity
-Surge:momentary increase in voltage | Cause: Lightning strikes, solar flares, or electrical problems
-Noise:fluctuation in voltage level |
-Brownout:momentary decrease in voltage
-Blackout:complete power loss
=Things to do=

**Backup Types**
-Full volume backup: All files are backed up, regardless of the archive bit, and the archive bit is removed if set
-Incremental: Modified / created files have an archive bit set, and will remove the bit. Shorter backup time, requires longer restoration time.
-Differential: Modified / created files that have an archive bit, and will keep the bit. Longer backup time as the week progresses, however shorter restoration time.
if you lose progress Thursday week 5, to recover you must goto week4 full volume + week 5 monday->wednesday incremental || week5 wednesday differential
