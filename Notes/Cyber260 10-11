Static Routing
	-A network administrator configures a routing table to direct messages
		along specific paths.
	-between a small bussiness and an isp
	-Manually configured
	-They dont learn routes automatically
	-If it goes down you have to manually fix it
	
Dynamic Routing
	-A router automatically calculates the best path between two networks
		and maintains this informaton in a routing table
	-The router can detect problems with failed or congested routes
		and reroute messages through a different path.
	
	BENEFITS
	Automatically find remote networks by sharing routing information
	between routeres on a network
	
	Maintain an up to date routing table on all routers within the network

Routing metrics
	-Hop Count
	-Theoretical badnwtih
	-delay / latency
	-Load
	-MTU(maximum transmission unit) or the largest IP packet size without fragmentmentation
	-Routing cost
	-Reliabiltiy of a potential path
	-Topology of a network
The lowest score wins, the score is all of these calculated.

OSPF - Open Shortest Path First
	-Supports a large network
	-More CPU + Memory
	-Prevents routin loops
	-Shared data
	-Multi vender routers
	-Stability
	
RIP - Routing Information Protocol (legacy protocol)
RIPng - Supports Ipv6 the newest RIP version
IS-IS - Intermediate System to Intermediate system
EIGRP - Enanced interior gate routing protocol
	-Less computing
	-Easy to configure
	-Was originally proprietary to cisco routers
	-It is refered as a hybrid protocl
BGP - Border gateway protocol is the only routing protocl that communicates across the internet.
	-Spans multiple autonomos system
	-Special characteristics of BGP the following
		-Path vector routing protocl
		-Efficent
		-Customizable
	-BGP is the most complex of the routing protocols.

QoS Prioritization
	1:Traffic enters the router's interface
	2:QoS tool is used to classify incoming traffic
	3:Traffic is placed into a waiting queue with a priority
	4:Packets with a higher priority are transmmited before low priority
